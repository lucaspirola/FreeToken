# Supported models

FreeToken loads HF safetensors checkpoints directly (plus native GGUF for
Gemma-4, Qwen3.5-MoE/Ornith, and Laguna). The checkpoints below are known-good —
the prebuilt kernels are tuned for them; other checkpoints of the same architectures
work too.

## MoE backends

`ft serve --moe-backend {auto,fused,offload,cpu,hybrid}`:

- **fused** — experts resident on GPU (needs the VRAM); never auto-selected.
- **offload** — experts live in host RAM, an LRU cache of expert slots on GPU;
  misses stream over PCIe.
- **cpu** — misses are computed on the CPU instead of fetched.
- **hybrid** — per step, fetches some misses over PCIe and computes the rest on
  CPU, overlapped. Run `ft bench bw` once per machine to calibrate the split.
- **auto** — dense models always resolve to `fused`; MoE models resolve to
  `offload`, upgraded to `hybrid` when a cached `ft bench bw` profile
  recommends it.

## Notes

- `ft checkpoint` conversion is optional — it pre-converts a checkpoint into
  FreeToken's fast-load format, and `ft serve --model` auto-detects the result.
- DeepSeek-V4 checkpoints must keep the `inference/config.json` subdir — the
  authoritative model args are read from there.
- Multimodal checkpoints are served text-only.
- Laguna-S INT4 needs the `offload` backend. On WSL, FreeToken automatically
  keeps enough layers on CPU when the mixed INT4/BF16 banks exceed the CUDA
  pinned-memory budget.
- A single-session 200K Laguna configuration on a 16 GB GPU should reserve the
  minimum 256 expert slots, use INT4 KV, and keep the SWA pool near its working-set
  floor: `--max-running-requests 1 --max-seq-len-override 200000 --num-tokens 200000
  --kv-cache-dtype int4 --moe-cache-size 256 --disable-moe-prefill-overlap
  --swa-full-tokens-ratio 0.006 --memory-ratio 0.95`.
- For Ornith Q4_K_M at 200K on a 16 GB GPU, use one request, Q4_0 KV, 5,000
  expert slots, and the default 8K prefill chunks: `--max-running-requests 1
  --max-seq-len-override 200000 --num-tokens 200000 --kv-cache-dtype q4_0
  --moe-backend offload --moe-cache-size 5000 --max-prefill-length 8192
  --memory-ratio 0.95`. On the RTX 2000 Ada/WSL test host, cold 32K TTFT was
  51.1 s at 8K chunks versus 54.6 s at 16K; `--moe-prefill-hit-d2d` was slower
  on this stack and should remain disabled. Install the optional SGLang kernel
  (`freetoken[sgl]`) for faster expert-route alignment. FreeToken's Q4_0 path matches
  llama.cpp's block quantizer and is validated with normal answers, OpenAI tool calls,
  and a 55.6K-token Claude Code Bash-tool round trip. The sm_89 attention tuning reduces
  a synthetic 200K full-attention layer from 2.42 ms to 0.92 ms; the live 55.9K decode
  ran at 36--48 tok/s after warmup. A coherent 169.9K-token live generation completed
  in 425.8 s of prefill and decoded at 27--35 tok/s. The full 262,144-token pool also
  fits this 16 GB host with the command above after replacing both 200000 values with
  262144. Ada now uses llama.cpp's int8-MMA Q4_K/Q6_K kernels only for measured Ornith
  shapes and batch bands: dense 8192-output projections at 8--448/512 rows, the
  Q6_K 2048-output projection at 8--64 rows, and both top-8 routed projections at
  272--16384 tokens. Larger dense chunks return to transient dequant+cuBLAS, which is
  faster on this 70 W GPU. In a cold, identical 96,026-token server A/B, TTFT fell from
  176.91 s (`FREETOKEN_GGUF_DISABLE_MMA=1`) to 125.26 s (29.2% lower, 1.41x faster).
  `int4` remains an alias for `q4_0`.
- On Blackwell (sm_120, e.g. RTX 5080 16 GB) the same command serves the **full
  262,144-token window**: `--attention-backend triton --max-seq-len-override 262144
  --num-tokens 262144 --kv-cache-dtype q4_0 --max-running-requests 1
  --moe-backend offload --moe-cache-auto --max-prefill-length 8192`. Pass the
  backend explicitly: sm_120 auto-resolves to FlashInfer, which cannot read the
  quantized KV pool. For one long Q4_K_M + Q4_0 KV session, add
  `--kv-grow-step-tokens 65536`; for Q6_K + Q8_0 KV use
  `--kv-grow-step-tokens 131072`. The Q8-specific 128K step avoids the expensive
  intermediate expert-cache rebuild seen with 64K steps on this host. Both reserve
  the full virtual KV address range while physically committing fixed-size segments.
  At each boundary FreeToken gives exactly enough expert-cache
  VRAM to the new KV segment, preserves all earlier KV at stable addresses, and
  recaptures decode graphs once after the final prefill chunk. This mode currently
  requires one running request, the Triton MHA path, plain `offload`, and
  `--moe-cache-auto`; it is opt-in because the changing expert geometry trades
  early-context speed against final-context decode residency. Runtime logs show
  both instant and cumulative-average prefill speed.
  The attention launch tables are
  architecture-aware: the sm_120 Q4_0 decode launch (64 splits, 64-token tiles)
  runs a synthetic 262K full-attention layer in 0.36 ms versus 0.82 ms with the
  sm_89 tuning, and the extend/prefill kernels drop to 4 warps (1.12x on long-Q4
  prefix extension, 2x on cold chunks). BLOCK_N=16 silently corrupts the packed
  Q4 loader on sm_120 exactly as on sm_89 and stays excluded. On sm_120 the
  Q4_K/Q6_K GGUF matmuls (dense prefill and large routed-expert batches) run on
  llama.cpp's int8-tensor-core MMQ (vendored under `kernel/csrc/gguf_mmq/`,
  JIT-built on first use): ~13x over the DP4A kernels and ~1.3x over transient
  dequant+cuBLAS at 8K-token chunks, with the same lossless packed weights. A
  second sm_120 pass tunes the fused routed+shared decode MMVQ to four output-row
  warps (about +2.2% live decode for both Q4 and Q6), moves the grouped-MMA prefill
  crossover from 320 to 272 tokens, and sends only measured small/output Q6_K
  projections back to transient dequant+cuBLAS (+18.0% on an 8K cold-prefill live
  A/B). Q4_K retains uncapped MMA: the analogous isolated-kernel change reduced
  end-to-end overlapped prefill and was rejected. At the exact 262,144-token gate,
  the Q6_K + Q8_0 128K-step configuration reached 527.36 tok/s average prefill,
  416.57 tok/s on the last full chunk, and 78.40 tok/s decode while recovering the
  deterministic needle coherently. That is +62.1% prefill and +32.0% decode over
  the same growable configuration with 64K steps.
- Nemotron 3 Super uses its native hybrid Mamba-2 / full-attention / latent-MoE
  architecture. The NVFP4 release needs about 60 GiB of host RAM for expert banks and
  10.3 GiB of resident GPU weights. FreeToken currently serves one concurrent Nemotron
  session. On WSL, `--moe-pageable-gpu` keeps the pin-budget overflow banks pageable,
  stages only their routed misses through a small pinned buffer, and still executes every
  ReLU² expert on GPU. This eager path disables CUDA graphs and prefill overlap. A minimal
  all-GPU-compute launch is:
  `ft serve --model nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4
  --max-running-requests 1 --moe-backend offload --moe-cpu-layers 0
  --moe-pageable-gpu --moe-cache-auto`.
